Forked third-party libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The libraries are located here as they are exposed via Nix, and since the
dev-env hashes `dev-env` and `nix` to initiate a new nix-build we need to store
them here.

gRPC-haskell, proto3-suite, proto3-wire:

Haskell protocol buffer and gRPC libraries. Forked as the upstream is behind
on supporting latest GHC versions, and gRPC-haskell was using old grpc C library.
